The below steps for using Android OpenCV sdk in Android Studio.

Download latest OpenCV sdk for Android from OpenCV.org and decompress the zip file.
Import OpenCV to Android Studio, From File -> Import Module, choose sdk/java folder in the unzipped opencv archive.
Update build.gradle under imported OpenCV module to update 4 fields to match your project build.gradle a) compileSdkVersion b) buildToolsVersion c) minSdkVersion and 4) targetSdkVersion.
Add module dependency by Application -> Module Settings, and select the Dependencies tab. Click + icon at bottom, choose Module Dependency and select the imported OpenCV module.
Copy libs folder under sdk/native to Android Studio under app/src/main.
In Android Studio, rename the copied libs directory to jniLibs and we are done.
Step (6) is since Android studio expects native libs in app/src/main/jniLibs instead of older libs folder. For those new to Android OpenCV, don't miss below steps

include static{ System.loadLibrary("opencv_java"); }
For step(5), if you ignore any platform libs like x86, make sure your device/emulator is not on that platform.
OpenCV written is in C/C++. Java wrappers are

Android OpenCV SDK - OpenCV.org maintained Android Java wrapper. I suggest this one.
OpenCV Java - OpenCV.org maintained auto generated desktop Java wrapper.
JavaCV - Popular Java wrapper maintained by independent developer(s). Not Android specific. This library might get out of sync with OpenCV newer versions.
